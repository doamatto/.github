**Anyone can conrtibute to my projects.** One thing people can do is report bugs, however, ensure that: 
- the issue hasn't been asked before (even if it's closed),
- you include as many details as possible,
- fill out the issue template properly,
- you are using the latest version of the project (the bug may have already been patched),
- give steps to reproduce,
- use a descriptive and clear title,
- try to include screenshots, GIFs, and debugger video so it's easier to see exactly what happens to cause the issue,
- ensure you can reliably reproduce the issue, and:
- include the version of the project you are using and the OS and OS version you're running the project on

Another thing people can do is suggest enhancements (again, make sure it hasn't already been suggested or implemented, then make sure you're descriptive on what you want to see added.
