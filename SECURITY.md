# Security Policy

Always ensure that you are on the latest version for optimal security patches.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability, please encrypt it with my PGP key ([you can find it on my website here](https://maatt.fr/key)) and send an email with the nature of the issue and how to reproduce the bug, as well as any reproducibility information you've already found to `security@doamatto.xyz`. Please include in the subject line `[Security Issue on GitHub]`.

Once you file a report, give me around 24-to-48 hours to respond letting you know if I can reproduce or not. I will do my best to fix any and all bugs, especially ones related to security issues. Otherwise, you will simply be included in the README as someone who fixed a severe bug.

When a bug is reported and approved to be an issue, notice of this issue will be in the security advisories section of this repository. You can access this by clicking the Security tab and navigating to Advisories.
